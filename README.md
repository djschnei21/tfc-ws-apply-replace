# tfc-ws-resource-replace
## What does it do?
This script targets a TFC workspace and runs the equivalent of a `terraform apply -replace=[]` on a dynamic set of resources determined by a provided keyword

## Why?
In certain TFC implementations, people will use a tightly controlled organization and workspace to create child organizations and workspaces. This is commonly referred to as the `workspace vending machine` approach.  In this model, the parent workspace is also responsible for managing the child workspace's credentials in the form of sensitive workspace variables.  However, setting those variables once and never rotating them introduces some risk.  Using this script, you can schedule the rotation of those credentials (or any other type of resource).  

## Usage
1. Set an environment variable `TFC_TOKEN` equal to a valid TFC token with adequate permissions
2. run `python3 rotate.py <org name> <workspace ID> <resource name filter>` where:
- `org name`: is the name of the org that contains your workspace
- `workspace ID`: is the ws-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx formatted ID of your target workspace
- `resource name filter`: is the beginning of the resource name string

## Example 
My parent workspace creates a child workspace and an IAM user specific to the child workspace.  It then generates `aws_iam_access_key` credentials and assigns them to the child workspace as a sensitive variable:
```terraform
resource "aws_iam_user" "iam_user" {
  name = "tfc_workspace_${tfe_workspace.workspace.name}"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "iam_user_policy_attach" {
  user       = aws_iam_user.iam_user.name
  policy_arn = var.workspace_iam_policy
}

resource "aws_iam_access_key" "workspace_creds" {
  user = aws_iam_user.iam_user.name
}

resource "tfe_variable" "aws_access_key_id" {
  key          = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
  category     = "env"
  value        = aws_iam_access_key.workspace_creds.id
  workspace_id = tfe_workspace.workspace.id
}

resource "tfe_variable" "aws_secret_access_key" {
  key          = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
  category     = "env"
  sensitive    = true
  value        = aws_iam_access_key.workspace_creds.secret
  workspace_id = tfe_workspace.workspace.id
}
```
If I wanted to replace/rotate the resource `aws_iam_access_key` (and by relation any resource that depends on it, i.e. the `tfe_variable.aws_secret_access_key` resource), I would use the resources given name `workspace_creds`

```
python3 rotate.py some-org ws-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx workspace_creds
-------------------------------------
TFC Organization Name: some-org
TFC Workspace ID: ws-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Resource Name FIlter: workspace_creds
-------------------------------------

Found 3 resources whose name(s) start with the keyword:

    module.ws_vending_machine["djs-ec2"].aws_iam_access_key.workspace_creds
    module.ws_vending_machine["djs-iam"].aws_iam_access_key.workspace_creds
    module.ws_vending_machine["djs-s3"].aws_iam_access_key.workspace_creds

While this workspace manages 23 resources in total, you can see below the script targeted only the resources needed to rotate the downstream workspace's access keys:

This script can be scheduled to rotate the credentials limiting the risk of bad terraform code leaking the sensitive variables.
